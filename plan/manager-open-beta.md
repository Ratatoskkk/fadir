# faðir open beta manager board

Updated: 2026-09-10. This is the only live work board.

## Goal and next action

Finish the hosted private-portfolio beta in [the product brief](../docs/OPEN_BETA_BRIEF.md).
The immediate user outcome is a browser that stays signed in after refresh and shows
the owner's original portfolio under the verified Google User.

**Hydration is accepted locally and published as `b22875e38a7174d823212bb291dcd78151e781bd`.**
The VM deployment and hosted public edge proof are now accepted. The next action is a
separately leased protected source/identity recheck and private migration dry run for
the approved `Ana Portföy`/TRY mapping; live cutover remains conditional on its pass.
Do not restart APP, identity architecture, credential rotation, or the completed
Transfer repair.

## Current authority

- Senior: `gpt-5.6-luna` / `max`. Specialists: `gpt-5.6-luna` / `medium`.
  Use the [shared work rules](../AGENTS.md) and [dispatch contract](README.md#dispatch-contract).
- The owner approved continued delivery through product completion, VM and public
  release, recovery proof, reviewed commits, and normal pushes to the existing origin.
  The Senior reviews; specialists implement under exact leases, one at a time.
- The owner explicitly assigned review and publication to the Senior: inspect each
  specialist's changes and required proof, then commit and push accepted paths to
  `origin/main`. Return unfinished work for repair/proof. Verify the remote commit
  and update the board before dependent implementation; no routine approval pause.
- Existing VM use, needed dependency installation in the VM, and Cloudflare MCP use
  are approved. Bound each operational change to its named resources and proof.
- `ratatosk.dev` is the approved domain. Google-only sign-in, deferred email recovery,
  deferred off-site backups, and direct Yahoo under the private permit remain settled.
- Private row inspection, a protected WAL-consistent snapshot, a private dry run, and
  conditional live migration after all validations were approved. The owner selected
  `Ana Portföy`, TRY Base Currency, and all legacy Transactions and Snapshots mapped
  to that Portfolio. The [migration runbook](../docs/PRIVATE_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md) separates
  those approvals from the technical preconditions still to be proved.
- Do not ask for those approvals again. Obtain only a missing concrete owner value or
  a new charge/destructive scope. No source deletion or destructive cleanup is authorized.
  Secrets and private values stay out of ordinary artifacts.

Authority includes the owner's 2026-09-10 instruction to publish the documentation
cleanup and make the Senior responsible for reviewing and pushing accepted specialist
work. The hydration publication changes no deployment; deployment remains a separate
Platform lease.

## Current checkpoint

### Facts

- Documentation baseline is published through `4d7e1f6` (`docs: record published
  coordination baseline`) and verified on `origin/main`; the earlier 21-file Markdown
  cleanup remains recorded in `e785b7e`.
- Hydration publication `b22875e38a7174d823212bb291dcd78151e781bd` is present on local
  `main` and `origin/main` with exactly `frontend/src/api.js` and
  `frontend/src/components/GoogleIdentityPanel.jsx`. The published files match the
  frozen hashes below.
- The hydration implementation checks `GET /api/user/sessions` on mount: 200 shows
  signed-in state, 401 returns to Google sign-in after guarded recovery, and other
  failures show a neutral retry state. Its retained handoff reports source checks
  and a successful frontend build. Fresh r3 evidence and independent Quality review
  accepted the component at 1440x900 and 375x812; see the evidence pointers below.
- The retained r1 red proof and r2 harness failure remain intact. r2 was not repaired in
  place; r3 used a separate plain-JavaScript harness that imported the real source.
- Platform deployment attempt `GOOGLE-SESSION-HYDRATION-DEPLOY-1` stopped before
  mutation: local build/archive and VM preflight passed, but the approved remote rollback
  parent was absent. The service remains unchanged with restart count zero. See the
  retained stop handoff at `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-deploy-r1/handoff.md`.
- Deployment follow-up `GOOGLE-SESSION-HYDRATION-DEPLOY-2` replaced the frontend bundle
  from the published manifest, preserved the nine-file rollback copy, restarted
  `fadir.service` exactly once, and verified loopback health 200. Both sanitized public
  probes returned HTTP 530. A read-only Cloudflare check shows tunnel
  `production-web-linux` (`d4e1cc1b-a37a-4ca6-9684-ffb91601bcc0`) is `down` with no
  connections; its saved route still points `ratatosk.dev` to `http://localhost:8000`.
  See `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-deploy-r2/handoff.md`.
- Tunnel repair `GOOGLE-SESSION-HYDRATION-TUNNEL-1` stopped read-only. The existing
  `cloudflared.service` is enabled but auto-restarting with `ExecMainStatus=255` because
  `/etc/cloudflared/token` is absent/empty. No connector restart, secret/config repair,
  Cloudflare write, DNS/Tunnel change, or application restart occurred. See
  `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-tunnel-r1/handoff.md`.
- A fresh read-only VM recheck after the Tunnel-1 handoff found the same protected
  precondition: the token remains absent/empty, `cloudflared.service` remains enabled
  in `activating/auto-restart` with `ExecMainStatus=255` and `NRestarts=4788`, while
  `fadir.service` remains active on `127.0.0.1:8000`. No repair or restart occurred.
- Tunnel repair `GOOGLE-SESSION-HYDRATION-TUNNEL-2` passed. The owner-provisioned
  token was present as root:root mode 600 without exposing its value. Exactly one
  existing `cloudflared.service` restart left it active/enabled with `ExecMainStatus=0`;
  the named tunnel had four healthy connections and its remote-managed configuration
  was unchanged. Loopback health, public `/api/health`, `/`, and both referenced
  hashed assets returned 200 and matched the deployed bundle. See
  `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-tunnel-r2/handoff.md`.
- The earlier Transfer repair was published as `0bb35e9`. Retained Quality, focused
  PostgreSQL, and final offline evidence report PASS; the final offline suite had
  512 passes. The deployment handoff records the route delta, one restart, and
  loopback/public health 200. Those results predate the hydration candidate.
- A later owner-visible Transfer succeeded. The retained read-only state handoff records
  one identity/User/Workspace chain, active User Sessions, consumed login, revoked
  Guest access, and zero Portfolios. Credential rotation has a successful retained
  handoff and is not unfinished work.

### Limits

Hydration acceptance is component-level local synthetic browser proof only. It has no
persisted PNG paths; the r3 manifest, DOM observations, request log, and inline browser
captures are retained. The current host's focused backend session-route test could not
collect because system Python lacks `sqlalchemy`; no backend pass is inferred. No
full-App, owner-browser, authenticated User, migration, or full beta acceptance exists.
The VM bundle, loopback service, tunnel, and public static/health reachability are
accepted; no authenticated or private-data acceptance is inferred.

### Uncertainty

The r1 full-App synthetic fixture still crashes before rendering the panel; this remains
a harness limitation, not an established App defect. The r3 signed-out mobile state
needed one extra observation before settling. The exact protected identity/Workspace
binding and current source/target migration context must be rechecked at execution time.
The persisted Transfer timestamps were internally correlated but were not tied to an
authoritative screenshot time window.

### Open work

Assign Identity and Data Integrity the bounded private migration dry-run lease below.
Reconfirm the protected Google issuer/subject, its exactly-one User/Workspace chain,
the source snapshot, and an isolated non-serving target before any target write. Do not
open a live cutover lease until every dry-run validation passes.

## Resumable assignment

Status: **hydration accepted; VM deployment and public edge passed; private migration dry run pending**.
No specialist is active. The next bounded lease is `PRIVATE-MIGRATION-DRYRUN-1`.
The Product Experience browser, Quality, deployment, and Tunnel leases are closed.

The next migration lease must use the approved source, protected service context, and
isolated target only:

| Field | Exact scope |
|---|---|
| Outcome | Recheck the approved SQLite source and verified Google User/Workspace context, create one isolated non-serving PostgreSQL target, run the approved `Ana Portföy`/TRY dry run, and validate every mapping, ownership, isolation, fidelity, rollback, and source-preservation category |
| Repository writes | Empty; no product or migration source change is leased |
| Repository reads | `AGENTS.md`, `plan/README.md`, `plan/specialists/identity-and-data-integrity.md`, `docs/PRIVATE_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md`, `app/services/private_migration.py`, `app/services/private_migration_adapters.py`, relevant models/migrations, and the current board |
| Evidence reads | `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260909/dryrun-r1/handoff.md`, `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260909/dryrun-r2/handoff.md`, `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260909/post-transfer-state-r1/handoff.md`, and `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260909/credential-rotation-r1/handoff.md` |
| Operational writes | Fresh absent `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/private-migration-r1/` only; source `C:/Games/Agents/dashboard C/fadir.db` through a real SQLite snapshot transaction, approved VM `fadir-control-lab-01` with strict SSH key `C:/ProgramData/fadir-agent-control/lab_ed25519`, known hosts `C:/ProgramData/fadir-agent-control/lab_known_hosts`, mandated VM interpreter `/home/fadir-agent/fadir-tests/venv/bin/python`, protected existing PostgreSQL context, and one isolated marker/OID-guarded non-serving target outside the service search path |
| Handoff | `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/private-migration-r1/handoff.md` |
| Proof | Preserve or refresh a WAL-consistent snapshot as required, prove exactly one eligible Google issuer/subject -> User -> Workspace chain, validate schema, ownership, shared separation, reconciliation, value/Decimal fidelity, cross-Workspace denial, repeatability, rollback/unknown-outcome behavior, source hash/parity, target isolation, and cleanup guards without exposing private values |
| Completion | Four-section handoff with PASS/BLOCKED/UNKNOWN status, sanitized category results and artifact hashes, protected resource/marker/OID checks, source preservation, and no live cutover or service configuration change |
| Stop | Identity/schema ambiguity, source mismatch, invalid/unmatched rows, missing target guards, failed validation, concurrent writer/freeze requirement, unknown transaction outcome, destructive cleanup, any public/provider/Cloudflare action, or any need to modify product code/configuration |

Do not start an owner-browser sign-in or change the product during this dry run. Private
source and target inspection is permitted only through the protected channels named
above; no identity, issuer, subject, email, holdings, transaction values, or secrets may
enter ordinary artifacts. If the protected target context is not uniquely selectable,
stop with the smallest next action. Any adapter repair, live cutover, service
configuration change, browser acceptance, or public proof requires a separate lease.

Proof root: `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260909/`.
Paths in the evidence row are relative to this proof root.

## Delivery sequence and acceptance gates

The original phase order remains the dependency map. These are bounded recorded
results, not a fresh release certification. Do not repeat a completed gate without
changed source, failed evidence, or a newly established risk.

| Gate | Recorded state | Remaining outcome |
|---|---|---|
| G0 Coordination | Baseline exists; current instructions reconciled | Keep this checkpoint current |
| G2 Average Purchase Price | Accepted locally in earlier history | Retain the accepted lifetime purchase-average rule |
| G3 PostgreSQL and private scope | Conditional synthetic acceptance; later request scope and route work published | Complete the owner's private dry run/migration and its acceptance |
| G4 Guest and identity | Guest, Google transitions, Merge, session controls, and hydration candidate published; component hydration PASS | Accept hosted User refresh and finish Guest/User browser and session journeys |
| G5 Portfolios, currencies, tax | Portfolio selection, Fee Currency, Tax Profile backend/UI published | Finish full user journeys and close the missing independent Tax Profile review artifact |
| G6 Market data | Shared refresh route/worker published; direct Yahoo decision retained | Establish hosted cache, refresh, quota, source/time, and permitted public-use acceptance |
| G7 Security and data rights | Scoped routes, exports and deletion delivered; no-cookie denial matrix recorded | Finish authenticated isolation, data-rights UI, notices, abuse controls, and the recorded missing public security headers |
| G8 VM and public service | VM/Tunnel service, HTTPS health, bounded Guest denial and Google start observed | Accept the deployed user journeys and exact final release state |
| G9 Final acceptance and recovery | Earlier bounded VM rollback/reconstruction proof exists | Final browser/product/release acceptance; carry its version and data-recovery limits forward |

G9 needs the remaining G3–G8 outcomes. A public health 200, no-cookie 401, or local
suite pass cannot close an authenticated journey. Off-site backup and lost-Portfolio
recovery guarantees remain outside this beta.

After deployment and owner refresh acceptance, queue these outcomes one at a time:

1. Complete the protected migration into the verified Google User's `Ana Portföy`/TRY
   and prove that the original portfolio is accessible after refresh.
2. Reconcile and close the remaining G4–G7 product and security acceptance items against
   the beta brief. Check Guest product parity, including tax behavior; do not silently
   redefine full Guest use around the currently implemented User-only Tax Profile panel.
3. Complete G8/G9 on the accepted release, with browser, restart, rollback, and service
   reconstruction evidence appropriate to the actual change.
