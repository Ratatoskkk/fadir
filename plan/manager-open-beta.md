# faðir open beta manager board

Updated: 2026-09-10. This is the only live work board.

## Goal and next action

Finish the hosted private-portfolio beta in [the product brief](../docs/OPEN_BETA_BRIEF.md).
The immediate user outcome is a browser that stays signed in after refresh and shows
the owner's original portfolio under the verified Google User.

**Hydration is accepted locally and published as `b22875e38a7174d823212bb291dcd78151e781bd`.**
The next action is a separately leased deployment proof for that frontend delta. The
subsequent private migration is approved in principle but has not passed its dry run.
Do not restart APP, identity architecture, credential rotation, or the completed
Transfer repair.

## Current authority

- Senior: `gpt-5.6-luna` / `max`. Specialists: `gpt-5.6-luna` / `medium`.
  Use the [shared work rules](../AGENTS.md) and [dispatch contract](README.md#dispatch-contract).
- The owner approved continued delivery through product completion, VM and public
  release, recovery proof, reviewed commits, and normal pushes to the existing origin.
  The Senior reviews; specialists implement under exact leases, one at a time.
- The owner explicitly assigned review and publication to the Senior: inspect each
  specialist's changes and required proof, then commit and push accepted paths to
  `origin/main`. Return unfinished work for repair/proof. Verify the remote commit
  and update the board before dependent implementation; no routine approval pause.
- Existing VM use, needed dependency installation in the VM, and Cloudflare MCP use
  are approved. Bound each operational change to its named resources and proof.
- `ratatosk.dev` is the approved domain. Google-only sign-in, deferred email recovery,
  deferred off-site backups, and direct Yahoo under the private permit remain settled.
- Private row inspection, a protected WAL-consistent snapshot, a private dry run, and
  conditional live migration after all validations were approved. The owner selected
  `Ana Portföy`, TRY Base Currency, and all legacy Transactions and Snapshots mapped
  to that Portfolio. The [migration runbook](../docs/PRIVATE_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md) separates
  those approvals from the technical preconditions still to be proved.
- Do not ask for those approvals again. Obtain only a missing concrete owner value or
  a new charge/destructive scope. No source deletion or destructive cleanup is authorized.
  Secrets and private values stay out of ordinary artifacts.

Authority includes the owner's 2026-09-10 instruction to publish the documentation
cleanup and make the Senior responsible for reviewing and pushing accepted specialist
work. The hydration publication changes no deployment; deployment remains a separate
Platform lease.

## Current checkpoint

### Facts

- Documentation baseline is published through `4d7e1f6` (`docs: record published
  coordination baseline`) and verified on `origin/main`; the earlier 21-file Markdown
  cleanup remains recorded in `e785b7e`.
- Hydration publication `b22875e38a7174d823212bb291dcd78151e781bd` is present on local
  `main` and `origin/main` with exactly `frontend/src/api.js` and
  `frontend/src/components/GoogleIdentityPanel.jsx`. The published files match the
  frozen hashes below.
- The hydration implementation checks `GET /api/user/sessions` on mount: 200 shows
  signed-in state, 401 returns to Google sign-in after guarded recovery, and other
  failures show a neutral retry state. Its retained handoff reports source checks
  and a successful frontend build. Fresh r3 evidence and independent Quality review
  accepted the component at 1440x900 and 375x812; see the evidence pointers below.
- The retained r1 red proof and r2 harness failure remain intact. r2 was not repaired in
  place; r3 used a separate plain-JavaScript harness that imported the real source.
- Platform deployment attempt `GOOGLE-SESSION-HYDRATION-DEPLOY-1` stopped before
  mutation: local build/archive and VM preflight passed, but the approved remote rollback
  parent was absent. The service remains unchanged with restart count zero. See the
  retained stop handoff at `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-deploy-r1/handoff.md`.
- Deployment follow-up `GOOGLE-SESSION-HYDRATION-DEPLOY-2` replaced the frontend bundle
  from the published manifest, preserved the nine-file rollback copy, restarted
  `fadir.service` exactly once, and verified loopback health 200. Both sanitized public
  probes returned HTTP 530. A read-only Cloudflare check shows tunnel
  `production-web-linux` (`d4e1cc1b-a37a-4ca6-9684-ffb91601bcc0`) is `down` with no
  connections; its saved route still points `ratatosk.dev` to `http://localhost:8000`.
  See `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-deploy-r2/handoff.md`.
- Tunnel repair `GOOGLE-SESSION-HYDRATION-TUNNEL-1` stopped read-only. The existing
  `cloudflared.service` is enabled but auto-restarting with `ExecMainStatus=255` because
  `/etc/cloudflared/token` is absent/empty. No connector restart, secret/config repair,
  Cloudflare write, DNS/Tunnel change, or application restart occurred. See
  `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-tunnel-r1/handoff.md`.
- The earlier Transfer repair was published as `0bb35e9`. Retained Quality, focused
  PostgreSQL, and final offline evidence report PASS; the final offline suite had
  512 passes. The deployment handoff records the route delta, one restart, and
  loopback/public health 200. Those results predate the hydration candidate.
- A later owner-visible Transfer succeeded. The retained read-only state handoff records
  one identity/User/Workspace chain, active User Sessions, consumed login, revoked
  Guest access, and zero Portfolios. Credential rotation has a successful retained
  handoff and is not unfinished work.

### Limits

Hydration acceptance is component-level local synthetic browser proof only. It has no
persisted PNG paths; the r3 manifest, DOM observations, request log, and inline browser
captures are retained. The current host's focused backend session-route test could not
collect because system Python lacks `sqlalchemy`; no backend pass is inferred. No
full-App, hosted/public, owner-browser, authenticated User, migration, or full beta
acceptance exists. The VM bundle and loopback service are accepted; the tunnel and
public edge are blocked on protected credential repair.

### Uncertainty

The r1 full-App synthetic fixture still crashes before rendering the panel; this remains
a harness limitation, not an established App defect. The r3 signed-out mobile state
needed one extra observation before settling. The missing token's protected source and
intended repair mechanism are unknown and must not be guessed. The persisted Transfer
timestamps were internally correlated but were not tied to an authoritative screenshot
time window.

### Open work

Owner input is required for a protected secret/configuration-repair lease for the
existing connector. After that value/mechanism is supplied, Platform can restart only
`cloudflared.service` once and re-prove the three public probes. Do not begin owner
refresh or private migration until the public edge is healthy.

## Resumable assignment

Status: **hydration accepted; VM deployment passed; public edge blocked pending protected token repair**.
No specialist is active. The next owner-gated lease is `GOOGLE-SESSION-HYDRATION-TUNNEL-2`,
after a protected operational source/mechanism for the existing token is supplied. The
Product Experience browser, Quality, deployment, and Tunnel-1 leases are closed.

The deployment lease must use the approved VM and existing allowlisted mechanism:

| Field | Exact scope |
|---|---|
| Outcome | Restore the existing `production-web-linux` connector using an owner-supplied protected token mechanism, then prove public health, shell, and bundle reachability |
| Repository writes | Empty; source and bundle are already published |
| Repository reads | `AGENTS.md`, `plan/README.md`, `plan/specialists/platform-and-release.md`, `docs/OPEN_BETA_BRIEF.md`, and the two deployment handoffs below |
| Evidence reads | `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-deploy-r1/handoff.md`, `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-deploy-r2/handoff.md`, and the current board's recorded Cloudflare read-only result |
| Operational writes | Fresh absent `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-tunnel-r2/` only; approved VM `fadir-control-lab-01` at `192.168.247.10`, strict SSH key `C:/ProgramData/fadir-agent-control/lab_ed25519`, known hosts `C:/ProgramData/fadir-agent-control/lab_known_hosts`, protected owner-supplied token injection through its exact mechanism, existing connector service unit only, and read-only Cloudflare account `f564f7c408cccd5b898d51cc9ae26db5` tunnel `d4e1cc1b-a37a-4ca6-9684-ffb91601bcc0` |
| Handoff | `C:/Users/doguk/AppData/Local/Temp/fadir-private-migration-20260910/session-hydration-tunnel-r2/handoff.md` |
| Proof | Capture the current unit/configuration/connector red state, record protected token injection without exposing the value, perform exactly one restart of the verified existing connector unit, then verify connector/tunnel status and sanitized public `/api/health`, `/`, and referenced asset responses |
| Completion | Four-section handoff with red/green status, no config/DNS mutation, exact restart count, local/public probe results, and cleanup; keep hosted edge proof separate from authenticated User, migration, and beta acceptance |
| Stop | Missing owner mechanism or token, failed/unknown restart, any Cloudflare write, private/provider request, or any need to change DNS/Tunnel configuration |

Do not start Google sign-in or access the owner database for this proof. Do not patch
`App.jsx` because an incomplete fixture crashed. If the specialist lacks a browser
surface, it can prepare a reproducible harness for Senior acceptance; it cannot claim
the missing browser result. If new evidence requires a rebuild or source repair, the
Senior revises the lease before execution.

## Delivery sequence and acceptance gates

The original phase order remains the dependency map. These are bounded recorded
results, not a fresh release certification. Do not repeat a completed gate without
changed source, failed evidence, or a newly established risk.

| Gate | Recorded state | Remaining outcome |
|---|---|---|
| G0 Coordination | Baseline exists; current instructions reconciled | Keep this checkpoint current |
| G2 Average Purchase Price | Accepted locally in earlier history | Retain the accepted lifetime purchase-average rule |
| G3 PostgreSQL and private scope | Conditional synthetic acceptance; later request scope and route work published | Complete the owner's private dry run/migration and its acceptance |
| G4 Guest and identity | Guest, Google transitions, Merge, session controls, and hydration candidate published; component hydration PASS | Accept hosted User refresh and finish Guest/User browser and session journeys |
| G5 Portfolios, currencies, tax | Portfolio selection, Fee Currency, Tax Profile backend/UI published | Finish full user journeys and close the missing independent Tax Profile review artifact |
| G6 Market data | Shared refresh route/worker published; direct Yahoo decision retained | Establish hosted cache, refresh, quota, source/time, and permitted public-use acceptance |
| G7 Security and data rights | Scoped routes, exports and deletion delivered; no-cookie denial matrix recorded | Finish authenticated isolation, data-rights UI, notices, abuse controls, and the recorded missing public security headers |
| G8 VM and public service | VM/Tunnel service, HTTPS health, bounded Guest denial and Google start observed | Accept the deployed user journeys and exact final release state |
| G9 Final acceptance and recovery | Earlier bounded VM rollback/reconstruction proof exists | Final browser/product/release acceptance; carry its version and data-recovery limits forward |

G9 needs the remaining G3–G8 outcomes. A public health 200, no-cookie 401, or local
suite pass cannot close an authenticated journey. Off-site backup and lost-Portfolio
recovery guarantees remain outside this beta.

After deployment and owner refresh acceptance, queue these outcomes one at a time:

1. Complete the protected migration into the verified Google User's `Ana Portföy`/TRY
   and prove that the original portfolio is accessible after refresh.
2. Reconcile and close the remaining G4–G7 product and security acceptance items against
   the beta brief. Check Guest product parity, including tax behavior; do not silently
   redefine full Guest use around the currently implemented User-only Tax Profile panel.
3. Complete G8/G9 on the accepted release, with browser, restart, rollback, and service
   reconstruction evidence appropriate to the actual change.
